##
# Installs a before_action into all controllers which echoes the
# request's method as a cookie named `_up_request_method`.
#
# The Unpoly requires this cookie to detect whether the initial page
# load was requested using a non-GET method. In this case the Unpoly
# framework will prevent itself from booting until it was loaded
# from a GET request. For the terrible reasons behind this see:
